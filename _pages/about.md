<p>Postdoctoral fellow at Universität Wien,</p>
<p>formerly a postdoc at Universitet København and the University of Melbourne.</p>

<p>I'm a theoretical particle physicist/ particle phenomenologist, my primary research interest is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I am interested in studying the SMEFT as a Quantum Field Theory and understanding its phenomelogy beyond leading order in both the loop and SMEFT expansions. I focus on Higgs and Electroweak physics, but have also worked in flavor physics and baryogenesis.</p>
