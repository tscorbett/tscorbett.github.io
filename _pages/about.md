<p>Postdoctoral fellow at Universität Wien,<br>
<p>formerly a postdoc at Universitet København and the University of Melbourne. PhD from C.N. Yang Institute for theoretical physics at SUNY Stony Brook.</p>

<p>I'm a theoretical particle physicist/particle phenomenologist, my primary research interest is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). 
I am interested in studying the SMEFT as a Quantum Field Theory and understanding its phenomelogy beyond leading order in both the loop and SMEFT expansions. 
I have played a major role in the development of the geoSMEFT, an approach to the SMEFT that greatly simplifies calculations and allows for a more profound understanding of the SMEFT from geometric considerations.
My phenomenological focus is on Higgs and Electroweak physics, but am interested in and have also worked on flavor physics and baryogenesis.</p>
