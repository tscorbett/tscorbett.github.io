<b>Fall 2023 - "Modern Methods in Particle Physics" (Master's/PhD, 27 lectures, still in development)</b><br>
A rapid introduction to Quantum Field Theory, culminating in lectures on Effective Field Theories and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.
The course develops QFT through the path integral formulation focusing on developing calculational techniques necessary for particle physics research.
The notes were primarily developed following the textbooks by Sterman, Srednicki, and Schwartz.<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Spin, Irreps, Lorentz Group, some Path Integrals<br>
pdf: 1_Irreps_LorentzGroup.pdf
Chapter 2 - Path integrals and Generating functions in Scalar field theory<br>
Chapter 3 - Lagrangains fro Fermions, Dirac Algebra, Path Integrals for Fermionic fields<br>
Chapter 4 - Path Integrals for Vector fields, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)<br>
Chapter 5 - Loop Integrals, Renormalization in Scalar field theory, Renomalizability<br>
Chapter 6 - Loops, Renormalization, and RGEs in QED<br>
Chapter 7 - Yang Mills Theory<br>
Chapter 8 - Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and the Standard Model<br>
